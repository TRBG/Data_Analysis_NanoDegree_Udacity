# Data_Analysis_NanoDegree_Udacity
This some of the codes I created (or modified) through my work in the Udacity Data Analysis Nano Degree.The codes are categorized based on the different sections within the nano degree.

In this repo, most (if not all) of the codes are based on Python 3 and utilizes Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib libraries.

## The following are the sub repos (corresponding to the different sections of the course)

### Introduction to Data Analysis 
In this repo I provide Jupyter notebooks that focus on exploring data sets and providing some visualizations of the analysis I performed on the data.

### Practical Statisitcs
In this repo I provide Jupyter notebooks that focus on descriptivs and some inferential statistics of Data sets. It includes A/B Testing and Regression.
