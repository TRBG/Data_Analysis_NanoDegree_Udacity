# Data Analysis NanoDegree - Udacity
This is some of the codes I have created (or modified from the given examples in the Nano Degree) through my work in the Udacity Data Analysis Nano Degree. The codes are categorized based on the different sections within the Nano Degree.

In this repo, most (if not all) of the codes are based on **Python 3** (for more info click [here](https://www.python.org/)). The codes also utilize the following Python libraries:

- **Numpy** (for more info click [here](http://www.numpy.org/))
- **Pandas** (for more info click [here](https://pandas.pydata.org/about.html))
- **Matplotlib** (for more info click [here](https://matplotlib.org/))

The codes are also written (mostly) as [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks and through the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) distribution.

## Organization
This repo is divided into several subfolders (subdirectories). Each of the directories contains codes and documents corresponding to a subsection of the Nano Degree. The following are the subdirectories so far:

### Introduction to Data Analysis 
In this repo I provide Jupyter notebooks that focus on exploring data sets and providing some visualizations of the analysis I performed on the data.

### Practical Statisitcs
In this repo I provide Jupyter notebooks that focus on descriptivs and some inferential statistics of Data sets. It includes A/B Testing and Regression.
